Close a subscription
====================

Have you ever wanted to cancel a subscription but could not figure out how to cancel it? Indeed,
it may be difficult to find the cancel button. In addition, many companies make it hard to cancel.

But if you are in the long-term subscription business model, especially in an era of ultra-fast
communications between dissatisfied customers, you want to give them a choice. Therefore, make it
easy for customers to leave if they want to. You can certainly ask them why they're leaving, or
try to win them back, but don't get in their way.

In summary, Odoo Subscriptions help you manage your subscriptions so you can give your customers the
possibility to cancel when they wish!

Configuration
=============

Before configuring your Odoo Subscriptions application, be sure to check out our documentation on
how to :doc:`Use subscription templates <../../subscriptions/configuration/subscription_templates>`
and
:doc:`Create subscription products <../../subscriptions/configuration/subscription_products>`.

Indeed, when you will create your first *Subscripiton templates*

Close your first subscription
=============================

Before closing a subscription, be sure to check out our documentation on how to
:doc:`Use subscription templates <../../subscriptions/configuration/subscription_templates>`,
:doc:`Create subscription products <../../subscriptions/configuration/subscription_products>` and,
how to
:doc:`Create a quotation <../../subscriptions/sales_flow/create_a_quotation>` using subscription
products.

Indeed, once confirmed, a quotation becomes a sales order and a new subscription is
automatically created. Therefore, this subscription has the status *In progress*. From there, you
have the possibility to renew the subscription. In the Other Info tab, underneath the To Renew
section, you can activate the *To renew* option. When activated, a yellow tag automatically appears
in the upper right corner of the subscription.
